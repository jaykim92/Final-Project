# The Anti-Social Social App

## Elevator Pitch
As people ease back into social gatherings, it is important to make informed decisions on how to socialize safely. The Anti-Social Social App allows users to see the population density in different parts of their cities to assist in this decision-making process. If you were wondering what areas should you avoid or which spots are safe to meet with your friends, let the Anti-Social Social App be your guide.

## Project Description
This web application provides population density information to users in an easily digestible way. The landing page shows a heatmap of which areas in your city are currently. Users can then log in to gain access to different features such as layering the heatmap with pinned locations for restaurants, parks, grocery stores, and hiking trails. You can also drop a pin on your current longitude and latitude to see how the population density in your surrounding areas.

## User Story
As a member of the community, I want to be able to see which areas in my city are open for hangouts and which areas are potentially unsafe, so that I can decide which areas to avoid or choose to hangout safely.
